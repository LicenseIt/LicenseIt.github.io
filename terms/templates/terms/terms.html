LicenseIt Licensing is a platform that enables you to purchase, using your LicenseIt Account, a service where we seek, at your request, to secure a music synchronization license, or "sync" for short, is a music license granted by the holder of the copyright of a particular composition, allowing the licensee to synchronize ("sync") music with some kind of visual media output (film, television shows, advertisements, video games, accompanying website music, movie trailers, etc.)

Licensing music for video and other type of visual media requires two things: the Master Use License and the Synchronization (Sync) license.

Master Use License
A master use license is a very important part of the legal process for licensing a song for a film, but as a singular license its powers are limited. This type of license is written permission for a specific recording of a work to be used — if it’s an original work (we’ll explain more about cover songs below). The license is granted by the owner of the master recording of the track. With just the master use license, a song may not legally be used for film.

Sync License
The second aspect of music licensing for film is the sync license. The sync license gives someone written permission to use a song alongside some sort of visual media. Most commonly sync licenses are used for films and commercials. This license must be paired with the master use license, which gives permission to use a specific recording.</span>
